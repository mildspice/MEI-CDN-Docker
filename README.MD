RMI file transfer with Docker containers.

## Build and Execute

- Make sure to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed on your machine.

- Open a terminal on this README directory and run:

    > docker-compose up

    *this command is enough to make everything running, though it is recomended to check on other relevant ``docker-compose`` commands, like ``docker-compose build``*
